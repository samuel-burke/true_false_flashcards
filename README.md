# true_false_flashcards

- Flashcards Tkinter app that can take questions that are formed in a True/False format. 
- Currently, this program collects random questions from the opentdb API, but could be reformatted to collect questions of your choice, as long as the program is updated to respond to the proper JSON format.
- Feel free to use/modify any portion of this program under the MIT license. 

Required setup:
- Since I am a MAC-OS user, I have decided to use the tkmacosx module, since some of tkinter's button features have some known problems. On the downside, this program is currently only compatible with **MAC-OS**
- pygame will need to be installed for the sound effects


Happy coding,
